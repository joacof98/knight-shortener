## Getting Started
After cloning this repository, if you already have NodeJS installed:

### In the /server and /client folders:
```
npm install
```

Also, in the server, in file config.ts, you need to put your own MongoDB URI for connect to a database.
## Run the app

### Init the server: (in /server folder)
```
npm run dev
```

### Init the client: (in /client folder)
```
npm start
```

## Usage
In the main page, just paste a long url, and you'll receive the short url generated (the domain knt.st is just for fun, its not deployed there ðŸ˜¬.)
After that, copy only the code and paste it right after '/' in your browser (running in localhost) and done!.
